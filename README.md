# Networking-RemoteTrojanControl
A trojan script with modules that perform exploitative task to the host. 

The sixth instalment in my networking projects series covers common tasks trojans perform on their hosts. These range from taking and recording screenshots to executing shellcode to provide interactive sessions to other tools like Metasploit. This trojan also performs a sandbox check to determine if it is operating within an antivirus sandbox.
